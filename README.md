# Ghost-Hands

This repository contains a demonstration video for a real-time, immersive Augmented Reality (AR) platform. The system allows a remote expert to guide a local user by streaming their hand movements as a 3D "ghost hand" into the user's AR headset.

## ðŸ“¹ The Demonstration Video

The included video (`Immersive_Demo.mov`) showcases the system's core functionality. You will see two roles:

* **The Expert (Controller):** Sits at a laptop. They see a live first-person video feed from the Operator. Using a hand-tracking sensor, they demonstrate actions with their own hands.
* **The Operator (User):** Wears an AR headset in a physical space. They see the Expert's virtual "ghost hand" overlaid on their real-world view, guiding them step-by-step.

## ðŸ’¡ Core Concept

The goal of this project is to create an intuitive "see-what-I-see, do-what-I-do" system. This moves beyond traditional remote assistance (like 2D pointers on a screen) by providing fully 3D, spatially-aware instructions.

Instead of just *telling* a user what to do, an expert can *show* them.

## âœ¨ Features Demonstrated

* **Real-time Hand Streaming:** The Expert's hand and finger movements are captured and streamed to the Operator.
* **Immersive 3D Guidance:** The Operator sees a 3D skeletal "ghost hand" model in their real-world space.
* **Live "See-What-I-See" Feed:** The Expert receives a live first-person video stream from the Operator's headset for complete context.
* **Intuitive "Do-What-I-Do" Interaction:** The Operator can simply mimic the movements of the virtual hand to complete complex physical tasks.
